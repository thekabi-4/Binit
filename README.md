# Binit

Waste Segregation Using Machine Learning

##  Overview

**Binit** is an experimental project focused on automating **waste segregation** through machine learning techniques. The goal is to help users correctly classify waste—like recyclables or organic materials—by analyzing visual or textual inputs.

##  Project Contents

The repository includes the following core files:

- **cam.html** – Likely a frontend interface to capture or display live inputs, e.g., webcam feed.
- **index.html** – The primary landing or interface page of the application.
- **metadata.json, model.json, weights.bin** – Essential files defining your trained ML model:
  - `model.json` – Model architecture definition
  - `weights.bin` – Pre-trained weights data
  - `metadata.json` – Additional model metadata (labels, preprocessing instructions, etc.)
- **source.html, source.txt** – Possibly supplementary documentation, source code, or explanatory materials about model generation or functionality.

> **Note:** If these file roles differ, feel free to update descriptions accordingly.

##  How to Use

### ℹ Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox) that supports WebGL / WebAssembly—or any necessary ML libraries.
- (Optional) A local or remote server environment to correctly serve `.json` and `.bin` files, avoiding CORS errors if invoked via browser fetch requests.

###  Running Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thekabi-4/Binit.git
cd Binit
```

### What Happens Next

index.html interfaces with the ML model hosted via model.json and weights.bin.
cam.html may allow direct image capture (e.g., webcam), feeding inputs into the model.
Use the UI to visualize the model's waste-category predictions based on your input.

### Training & Model Info (Future Updates)

(You can flesh this out if applicable later)
Environment used for training (e.g., TensorFlow.js, Python + TensorFlow/PyTorch).
Dataset sources and formats.
Instructions for retraining or fine-tuning the model.
